# React-Redux learning more about

This repository is part of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019" target="_balnk">Udacity React nanodegree</a> program which in the second part we understand more about redux with actions, reducers, middlewares (Redux Thunk and Sagas), etc.

It's a simple summary about the course approach and the concepts passeds.

At the path <a href="https://github.com/lejoaoconte/react-redux-learning-more-about/tree/main/simple-without-react-app">simple-without-react-app</a> you'll could see the exemplified approach on a simple html file importing react, redux, and other libraries directly on head html file.

However at the <a href="https://github.com/lejoaoconte/react-redux-learning-more-about/tree/main/my-react-app">my-react-app</a> path you'll see the approach with yarn create react-app system, but both are the same system a simple movies list.

Finally it's good to know that I altered the concept of project approached at the course which the idea was create a todo/goals list, but I converted to a movies list, it's involved a modify the API part to fit in I wanted.
